# WP-Project-Portfolio


- A portfolio is a living and changing collection of records that reflect your accomplishments, skills, experiences, and attributes. 
- It highlights and showcases samples of some of your best work, along with life experiences, values and achievements. The personal information that you incorporate into
your portfolio can greatly reflect on your abilities as an individual as well as become a useful tool in marketing yourself to employers, corporations,
colleges and universities. 
- A portfolio does not take the place of a resume, but it can accentuate your abilities and what you can offer in the chosen field.
